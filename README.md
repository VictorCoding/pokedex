### Senior Frontend Takehome Assessment

##### Utilize the free pokemon open API (https://pokeapi.co/) to build a simple Pokedex (Pokemon Index) SPA in Angular.

Requirements:
* A paginated and searchable list of Pokemon
* Detail page with moves and stat attributes (as many as you'd like to include from the various APIs)
* A way to save pokemon to a personal list ("Pokemon I've caught")
* A way to save pokemon I'd like to catch ("Pokemon Wishlist)
* Anything else you think would be cool!

Some explanation:

We're generally looking for code that covers:
* User input
* Persistence
* Routing
* Reactivity
* Error handling
* Responsiveness
* API calls / services
* Dependency management
* Testing
* UX

Leaving it to you to choose layouts and interactions!

Please deliver the code either as a github repository (add user @bounds to private repo if needed) or a zip file.

Bonus if the application is deployed.
